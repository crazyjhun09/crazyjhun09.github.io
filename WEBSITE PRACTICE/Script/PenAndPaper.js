I had him guessing the title for it and gave him a hint and said that it was a word that the female lead anime character from "Your Lie In April" said and he answered, "Again". But in reality, this title had a really deep meaning because to me, he really healed me. From really hating myself and hurting myself and slithing my wrist, he showed me that I can vent the negativity to other things. And that led me back to writing songs again.
